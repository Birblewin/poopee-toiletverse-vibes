          POOPEE can't and doesn't aim for intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. 
          There is no formal team or roadmap, and if there were, they would be complete slackers and couldn't be trusted anyway. 
          This entire project will self-destruct and can't even really be deemed entertainment value.
